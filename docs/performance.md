# Performance

<div class="bench-header" markdown>
<div markdown>

How fast each operation is, by storage width and scale.

The numbers on this page are **generated from CI**: the `bench-branch-compare`
run measures every `(operation, width, scale)` on a GitHub-hosted runner,
compares it against the previous release, and commits the medians to
`results/timing/`, which this page renders. They are refreshed on each release
PR.

> Absolute timings are machine-dependent — the *ratios* between operations and
> widths, measured in the same run, are what to read. Operands are `black_box`-ed
> so the optimiser can't fold the work away.

Times are the unit shown in each cell; the legend maps each unit to its size in
nanoseconds. Each function's graph plots median time (log scale) against storage
width: the two solid lines are scale `0` and the maximum scale, the dashed lines
the band-edge scales in between, and the shaded band is the spread between scale
`0` and the maximum.

The per-function tables and graphs are split across three category pages:
**[Arithmetic](performance/arithmetic.md)**,
**[Roots and Exponents](performance/roots-and-exponents.md)**, and
**[Trigonometry](performance/trigonometry.md)**.
