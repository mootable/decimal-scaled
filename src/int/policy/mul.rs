//! Multiply policy — the schoolbook-vs-Karatsuba algorithm matcher.
//!
//! Like division, the integer multiply choice keys on the **runtime
//! length** of the operands, not the const limb count `N`, so it is a
//! [`Select::ByValue`] case in the canonical policy shape (see
//! `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → "Policy file structure"): the const layer
//! settles on "the value decides", the value-matcher classifies the
//! operand lengths and returns an [`Algorithm`] tag, and the dispatcher
//! does an **exhaustive** `match algo` to a pure kernel in
//! [`crate::int::algos::limbs`].
//!
//! The kernels ([`mul_schoolbook`] / [`mul_karatsuba`]) stay pure; this
//! file owns the *choice* — the benched crossover threshold
//! ([`KARATSUBA_THRESHOLD`]) is policy DATA here, not a magic number in a
//! kernel.

/// through (via the `Int<N>` widening product), so one threshold governs
/// the crossover for every tier from one place. Set at **256 u64 limbs** —
/// above the widest equal-length multiply the crate emits (D1232 storage
/// = 64 limbs; the widest transcendental work-int is 192–256 limbs). At
/// this setting every shipped tier base-cases to the LLVM-unrolled
/// schoolbook [`mul_schoolbook`], so the kernel is reachable and correct
/// without changing the product behaviour of any shipped width.
///
/// NEEDS-BENCH: the 256 value is the spec/architecture default, not a
/// tuned crossover. It must be re-swept on the pinned GHA bench
/// (`benches/int_ops_micro.rs`, `mul_crossover`, plus the per-tier wide
/// `mul` cells) before being lowered to engage any shipped tier.
///
/// Must be `>= 4`: the recursion's z1 sum product runs on `⌈n/2⌉ + 1`
/// limbs, which only strictly shrinks below `n` once `n >= 4`, so a
