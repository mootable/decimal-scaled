//! Division policy — the divisor-shape algorithm matcher.
//!
//! Canonical policy shape (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → "Policy file
//! structure"), with one twist: division is the **one policy with no
//! const-width axis**. Its operands have *independent* runtime lengths that
//! no single level const expresses — the decimal `/` divides a `2N`-limb
//! scaled numerator by an `N`-limb divisor, and the slice roots
//! (`isqrt_newton` / `icbrt_newton` / `newton_reciprocal`) divide bare
//! `&[u64]` of runtime length with no `N` in their types at all. So unlike
//! a unary (`select<N>`) or binary (`select<Nthis, Nother>`) policy,
//! [`select`] here is **non-generic**: it always returns [`Select::ByShape`],
//! delegating the whole choice to the runtime [`select_for_limbs`]. (Forcing
//! a `<N>` would make the slice roots manufacture a const they don't have —
//! the kind of caller-side specialisation the architecture forbids — and
//! the divide doesn't use `N` anyway, since its engine choice is runtime.)
//!
//! Two selectors: [`select`] (the const matcher — here a no-op `ByShape`)
//! and [`select_for_limbs`] (the runtime limb-shape decision it delegates
//! to). The engines stay pure — each takes an already-chosen algorithm.
//! This file owns the *choice*: the benched crossover threshold
//! ([`BZ_THRESHOLD`]) is policy DATA here, not a magic number in a kernel.
